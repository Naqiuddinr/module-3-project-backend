# AutoFlex (Car Rental Booking System) ðŸš—

Hi! AutoFlex is my first full-stack project that I build from scratch as part of my Coding Bootcamp requirement to graduate.

AutoFlex utilised React.js and Node.js. This repo specifically store the code that I wrote for the back-end API endpoint.

+ If you want to see the front-end code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Naqiuddinr/module-3-project-autoflex)
+ AutoFlex is also live hosted using vercel, you can try it out [here](https://module-3-project-naqiuddinr.vercel.app/)

*Due to using the free version of Render(live host for backend), the app might take some time to load before you can see all the listed cars for rental.*
