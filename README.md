# AutoFlex (Car Rental Booking System) ðŸš—

Hi! AutoFlex is my first full-stack project that I build from scratch as part of my Coding Bootcamp requirement to graduate.

AutoFlex utilised React.js and Node.js. This repo specifically store the code that I wrote for the back-end API endpoint.

+ If you want to see the front-end code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Naqiuddinr/module-3-project-autoflex)
+ AutoFlex is also live hosted using vercel, you can try it out [here](https://module-3-project-naqiuddinr.vercel.app/)

*Due to using the free version of Render(live host for backend), the app might take some time to load before you can see all the listed cars for rental.*

## Project Background
The requirement was to create a full-stack booking system app, bonus point if we were able to create an admin page to manage the app as well. Since I love cars, I decided to create a car rental app like Socar.

## Tech Stack
| Fron-End         | Back-End                  | Additional         |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| ReactJS          | NodeJS / ExpressJS        | Vercel (Front-End) |
| Bootstrap / MUI  | Firebase                  | Render (Back-End)  |
| Redux            | Neon Console (PostgreSQL) |                    |

## Challenges
+ Handling dates : this was my first time using MUI Library - Datepicker. Took quite sometime to understand how to convert the data.
  - *Overcome* : console.log everystep of the way to understand the datatype of every conversion ðŸ˜‚
